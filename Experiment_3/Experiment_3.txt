Experiment 3

a) Employees have a number, date of birth (dd-mm-yyyy), rank, and salary. When an employee is first
    recruited then all these are given values of 0. Upon confirmation, the actual values of these are entered
    for the employee. Their rank can be incremented by 1 and when this happens an employee gets an
    increment of 25%. Write a C++ class for Employee.

b) Students are registered in a University. When students are created then they are given default values
    (zeroes or blanks) for roll_number, department, year, and semester of study. At registration time, the
    values of these attributes of student are updated with the proper values. Students can be promoted
    and their departments can be changed. Write a C++ class for Student.
