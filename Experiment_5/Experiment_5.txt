Experiment 5

Define two classes Distance1 and Distance2 in C++. Distance1 stores distance in miles and
Distance2 in kmeters & meters. Write a program that reads values of the class objects and adds one
object of Distance1 with the object of Distance2 class. The display should be in the format of miles
or kmeters & meters depending on the type of object (Distance1 or Distance2) being used to invoke
the function. (Hint: Make use of friend function).
